# Handwritten-Digit-Prediction
Using MNSIT handwritten digit dataset and keras for building the neural network, created a sequential model having three-layer, 
input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. Pre-processing of image involves scaling of the X-train and X-test for better and faster evaluation. For every input image, we will 
resize it to our requirements in gray scale, and if required then invert the image also.
